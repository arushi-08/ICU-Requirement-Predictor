# ICU Requirement Predictor


Predicting ICU Requirement for patients being tested positive or even before is the need of the hour. In this regard, this is a predictive modelling project to render insights and analysis of Patient's Condition.

Predictions are based on Logistic Regression Model trained on [Kaggle Covid19 patient pre-condition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tanmoyx/covid19-patient-precondition-dataset)
